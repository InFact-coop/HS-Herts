## The Challenge


## Our Solution?


 **The aims of the solution**


### Process 

__User Stories__
We began by aligning on the main user stories that were key to the success of the prototype. There were:


__Prototype__  
  
We then built prototypes in Figma to help map the user journey more thoroughly.


## Further Development
### User Testing
User testing allows you to get feedback from your primary users to check that the product being built fits their needs. This is __very__ important to build a successful product. 

The three key points for testing are:
- Have a script which has tasks for them to complete
- Ask for people to give you a commentry of what they are doing, but don't response to them
- Document their response

Here are some useful resources to look at when completing your user testing sessions:

Recommendations for user testing:


### Next Sprint
If this design is move forward for a build sprint it is important to concentrate on key features that both solves the initital problem and implements feedback from user testing.

Our current recommendation for initial features would be:

__or__ _*(depending on feedback from testing)*_:

* Collect the inputs from quantative questions and automate sending the data back to LCN on a weekly basis
