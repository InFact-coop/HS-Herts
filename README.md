## Our Solution?

**The aims of the solution**

Create a Web App where the Home Start Volunteer can report where he/she has started the visit, important notes about the visit and let HS coordinator is he/she needs to be contacted.

### Process 

__User Stories__

We began by aligning on the main user stories that were key to the success of the prototype. There were:

- [x] As a volunteer, I want to log when my visit starts and finishes
- [x] As a volunteer, I want to record how my visit went
- [x] As a volunteer, I want to see the details about my previous visits 
- [x] As a volunteer, I can let the HS coordinator know if I wanted to be contacted immediately or not.

__Prototype__  
  
We then built prototypes in Figma to help map the user journey more thoroughly.

## Further Development
### User Testing
User testing allows you to get feedback from your primary users to check that the product being built fits their needs. This is __very__ important to build a successful product. 

The three key points for testing are:
- Have a script which has tasks for them to complete
- Ask for people to give you a commentry of what they are doing, but don't response to them
- Document their response

Here are some useful resources to look at when completing your user testing sessions:
- [Googles Gurilla Testing Advice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YL0xoSmyZI&feature=youtu.be)
- [Script Guidance and Template](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/blob/master/coursebook/weeks-10-12/user-testing.md#1-planning)

Recommendations for user testing:

 * If you had to leave only one feature, which one would it be? 
 

### Next Sprint
If this design is move forward for a build sprint it is important to concentrate on key features that both solves the initital problem and implements feedback from user testing.

Our current recommendation for initial features would be:

* If the volunteer wants to be contacted immediately, the HS coordinator should receive a notification

__or__ _*(depending on feedback from testing)*_:
